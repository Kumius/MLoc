## Best Community Paper of Mobicom 2022

We report our experiences of developing, deploying, and evaluating **MLoc**, a smartphone-based indoor localization system for malls. **MLoc** uses Bluetooth Low Energy RSSI and geomagnetic field strength as fingerprints. We develop efficient approaches for large-scale, outsourced training data collection. We also design robust online algorithms for localizing and tracking users' positions in complex malls. Since 2018, MLoc has been deployed in 7 cities in China, and used by more than 1 million customers.
